# SudokuSolver

At the moment, this Android app merely encapsulates  code to solve 9x9 Sudoku boards by brute force...and
the only board it ever actually solves is a hard-coded test board.

When I have time I hope to add support for additional features that actually makes the app useful. In the meantime,
the Board class can serve as an example of a depth/first exhaustive search for a solution.
